Creating Block Patterns in WordPress

Block Patterns vs Reusable Blocks
- Block Patterns are like templates that you can reuse and change the content of
- Reusable blocks are blocks that are the same every time you use them, so if you make a change to the content of a block on one page, it'll change on all other pages
- Reusable blocks can start from a block pattern, but not the other way arounf

Adding Block Patterns to WordPress
- Can be added as part of a theme or as a seperate plugin
- If you want a block pattern to be used across multiple themes, plugin is the way to go
- For inspiration, check out the Block Patterns Directory

No Code Block Pattern Builder
- BlockMeister plugin!
- Limit use (dependancy)

When Adding to Your Theme 
- Create an /inc/ folder which stores a block-patterns.php file
- In functions.php, use require_once to include the block-patterns.php file
- Enqueue any pattern-specific CSS files

Creating Each Pattern
- Create the block patterns inside the block editor
- Select all of the blocks that are part of the pattern and copy them 
- Use a JSON encoder to convert the markup to a PHP-friendly format
- Use the register_block_pattern function to register the block pattern
- Save and repeat
- Can also use register_block_pattern_category function to do exactly what it sounds like

What is a JSON Encoder 
- JSON encoding is a way of taking a block of text and removing/replacing characters that could cause our code to break
- Mostly new lines and double quotes
- jsonformatter.org/json-escape
- Click on block in WordPress, Copy block, and paste code into formatter to get back PHP

How to Style Block Patterns
- Group all blocks together using Group, Columns, or even cover
- Apply a custom CSS class to the entire Group (Block sidebar > Advanced > Additional CSS Classes)
- Target group using .wp-block-group.[CSS-CLASS] (Customize > Additional CSS)

Adding Custom Plugins & Patterns to WordPress
- Compress into zip file, upload to plugins

Forms in WP 
- No form block in core 
- Ninja Forms plugin!

Content Upgrades
- By default, forms will log in WPadmin and email the site admin.
- Need to connect and ESP (MailChimp, ConvertKit) to deliver content upgrade which could cost extra
